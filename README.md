# Advent of TLA+

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) are popular computer programming challenges, which
can be solved in every programming language. But this repository makes a different take on
AoC problems: instead of *solving* them, it formally *specifies* their goals using TLA+.

For this kind of problems, it's hard to write a spefication that does not look awfully a lot
like a solution. It's important to remind that in general case a specification is very different
from code, and it has a different purpose.

Specification of parsing is deliberately ommited. For this reason, there's no specification for
day 4 of AoC 2020.
